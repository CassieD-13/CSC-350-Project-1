<h1> Hello and Welcome to My Homepage </h1><br><br><br>
 <h2>These are some things about me: </h2>
  <h2>My Favorite Hobbies: </h2>
  <ul>
<li><h3> Sewing</h3> </li>
   <p> Ever since I was young I loved to sew. My grandmother kept some sewing supplies in a cookie tin and whenever I was allowed to,<br>I would make anything out of anything. Today, my love of sewing has only grown and  I love to make clothing in my spare time</p>  <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/dining/27containers1/27containers1-superJumbo.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br>

<li><h3> Gardening </h3></li>
   <p>Although I am not the best at it, I love gardening. It's so calming and makes me feel connected to nature. I plan to have a large
   vegetable and flower garden in the future. </p> <img src="https://royalcitynursery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RC-blog-veggie-gardening1.png"width="300" height="200"><br>
<li><h3> Skating </h3></li>
   <p>I rollerskate and skate on my skateboard from time to time. I mainly skated in high school since I was apart of a skate club
   and had more free time but now not so much. I do plan on skating more since it's a really fun way to stay active.</p>
